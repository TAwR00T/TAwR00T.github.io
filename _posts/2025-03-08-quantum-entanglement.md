
### IMPLICATIONS FOR QUANTUM NETWORKS

This breakthrough has immediate applications for:

1. **Unhackable Communications**: Perfect forward secrecy with quantum key distribution
2. **Distributed Quantum Computing**: Linking quantum processors across continental distances
3. **Quantum Internet Backbone**: Establishing the foundation for global quantum networks

### QUANTUM DECOHERENCE SOLUTION

The primary innovation lies in our novel approach to quantum decoherence mitigation. Traditional methods rely on environmental isolation, but our approach actively compensates for decoherence through:

- Dynamic phase matching algorithms
- Adaptive error correction
- Quantum state reconstruction

### EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

The following data demonstrates the stability of our entangled qubits over time:

| Time (minutes) | Fidelity | Error Rate | Coherence |
|----------------|----------|------------|-----------|
| 0              | 0.999    | 0.001%     | 100%      |
| 1              | 0.998    | 0.002%     | 99.8%     |
| 2              | 0.998    | 0.002%     | 99.7%     |
| 3              | 0.997    | 0.003%     | 99.5%     |
| 3.8            | 0.995    | 0.005%     | 99.0%     |

### NEXT RESEARCH PHASE

Our team is now focusing on extending coherence time beyond the current 3.8-minute threshold. Theoretical models suggest we can achieve:

- 10+ minute coherence times by Q3 2025
- Potential for satellite-based entanglement by Q1 2026
- Global quantum network prototype by 2027
